# write a script that does a timing based side channel attack.
# the script should send a POST or GET request to the URL you found.
# one character at a time so first time the would program send 'C', then 'T' for example,
# then the script should measure the time, if the the response comes fast then probably
# no processing happened and we can assume that the chosen character was incorrect
# Flag format is CTFPI{..}

# hint: "CTFPI{" will be correct. Find what's inside the curly brackets.
