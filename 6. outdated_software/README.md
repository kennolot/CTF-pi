## NOTICE!

(This is relevant to building your own challenges too)

Turning real world vulns into challenges especially on Raspberry Pi is pretty painful.

Outdated software is a very big security concern on everyday computing, but also on IoT devices too!

"vulhub" on github, TryHackme, HackTheBox are good resources to learn more about and exploit old software.
