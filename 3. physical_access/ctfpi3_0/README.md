### Physical Access - Reading from exposed UART pins.

## Scenario

You've found a Raspberry Pi seemingly all by itself, you notice it has power and also has a few wires connecting it to another device.

It seems the connections correspond to UART, what could it mean?

Let's see if we can read what's being transmitted.


## Prerequisites

Have a microcontroller like raspberry pico or arduino etc. A way to read GPIO pins.

Raspberry Pi.

Jumper cables, typically F-F.

USB cable.

## Requirements
