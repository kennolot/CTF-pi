### Physical Access - Exploiting open USB ports with our own BadUSB. 3.

## Scenario

Now this challenge is a special one. You are the one now who creates the challenge.

There are many even more advanced scripts online to test out. Try some out or get inspiration to write your own.

See how far you can exploit your Raspberry Pi which has open USB ports.

After this challenge you should have a good understanding how dangerous exposed USB ports are when left in a remote environment.

## Prerequisites

Have a Raspberry pico with pico-ducky available.

Cable or adapter for connection.

Your own Raspberry Pi ready to be exploited.

## Requirements 

!! MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SCRIPT DOES, DON'T BLINDLY RUN !!

This site contains 14 pages of payloads or even scripts that protect your device(yes, the BadUSB doesn't have to be BAD)

## Cleaning up

Go through the source code of the script you find, make sure what it does and delete remains if there are any.
